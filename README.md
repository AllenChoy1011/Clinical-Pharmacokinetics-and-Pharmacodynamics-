# Clinical-Pharmacokinetics-and-Pharmacodynamics-

The course gives an understanding of how pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) information can be applied in clinical drug development. In addition, the course gives you sufficient knowledge to be able to contribute to the planning, design and analysis of clinical studies, from a PK and PD perspective.

Teaching and training are given in data analysis, study design, simulations of clinical trials and oral presentation. The course also includes topics such as disease progression, drug effects on disease progression, and PD models that describe these processes. Software for data analysis and simulation of clinical trials and result presentations are applied during the course.
